            <p class="cyberpunk inverse">
                I am an indie software developer, history enjoyer and video-games gourmand with a passion for creating perofmant and secure mobile apps.

                Back in 2009, when I was a fresh out-of-college Java dev I accidentally discovered the world of Mobile Development by accepting an Android project.
                It changed my life forever.
            </p>


            <p class="cyberpunk inverse px-28">

                Before a year was up, I dabbled in iOS development, getting to grips with the beautiful, the beastly,
                and the downright bizarre in UIKit. 
                Driven by a desire to ditch the boilerplate, I jumped head-first into functional
                programming and found myself tangled up in the wonderful world of FRP with ReactiveCocoa.
                Fast-forward to 2014, Swift entered the scene. I was right on board, keen to port parts of my projects
                where generics and optionals made the most sense. Since then I've tried programming from different sides:
                backend, embedded, blockchain, windows-phone, etc. I've launched a few apps, dipped my toes in the ocean of
                cryptography, messed with camera shaders and filters, and even tried my hand at running a small outsourcing company. It
                wasn't my cup of tea, though, and I found my way back to what I loveâ€”creating top-notch mobile products at
                scale.

            </p>

            <p class="cyberpunk inverse">
                I've always had a soft spot for iOS, but these days, I'm betting on Kotlin Multiplatform as the future
                of
                Mobile
                Development. So, I'm sharpening my skills there, alongside SwiftUI, looking to make the most of common
                modules
                and UI that can play nicely across platforms.
                Most of my past projects were running on RxSwift and Combine, but now, I'm all about structured
                concurrency:
                Async/Await and Coroutines.

                In my free time, I enjoy playing RGPs, board-games, airsoft, hiking, reading, and riding anything with a combustion engine.
